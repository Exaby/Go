# Go

This repo hosts the source code to some of my simple golang programs as well as links to compiled versions of my and others golang projects.

## Current Projects created and possibly maintained by me

  - lsjson: lists a directory and prints out its contents as a json file
    - example use lsjson > index.json

## Projects compiled by me but not maintained or created by me

  - e6dl: site downloader tool with arguments to change what to download ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
